<p>1/30 hi guys. today i worked with jaimie and cameron to develop our websites!</p><br>

<p>3/5 so far in computer science we have learned how to create our own websites, create codeskectches, and learn the basics of using javascript!</p><br>

<p>3/13 So far I have leared a lot of new things about coding. An eventListener takes something and makes it work, a variable represents what you created so you don’t have to type it multiple times, and functions accomplish certain things or get your code to work, or “function.” In addition, I learned about CSS at the very beginning, because it's what we used to style our websites, and Html is similar to that in which it helps organize the website. Lastly, the console is used for giving commands, terminal is what we used to publish our websites, and github is where we created our codepens.</p><br>

<p> 4/8 Today I worked on my animation codesketch. I decided to make one with cats! I was able to incorporate three different ones, the two additional being added using a shortcut. </p><br>



<p> 4/20 Today I finished coding my array on my favorite members from a kpop girl group called Twice! An array is a list of items that are variables that make my whole code sketch work. Using an eventlistener, its "listening" for an "event" to happen which is the mouse click, and when it "hears" the click the images put into the variables in the array will change. The images that appear are random because of the random number generator that I used, therefore you never know what picture of my favorite idols will pop up. Next, I also have functions which essentially tell the variables what to do. I can change what the variable does by changing the function which "tells" it a certain procedure to work, or "function."</p>

<br>

<p> 4/23 Today I made a loop of my favorite member from the kpop group Twice! Her name is Momo Hirai and she is the main dancer of the group. The loop essentially makes the gif that I inserted appear however many times I want and I can change that by changing the number. Since the loop recognizes only the most recent number that the i variable is set to, it automatically counts up from i=1 to i=2, i=3 and so on until it reaches the number I want it to stop at!</p>

<br>

<p> 5/25 This year in my first year of computer science I learned about sublime text, github, and different ways to start coding! At the beginning of my coding journey I learned how to create a website. To do this, I found some fonts that I liked on google fonts and I found some images and colors that I liked to create the background for my website. So I created a menu bar setting the width, height, color, and adding links to my journal, home, and projects page. To do this, I used divs with special names so that I could style each part of my homepage! In addition I styled sections of my website with a font that I liked, and after I was happy with it I copy and pasted the code to my other pages on my website. On my projects page I did something similar, but in my body I linked all of the names of my codesketches to the corresponding codesketches. For my journal page I coded something similar again, and I styled the font, made the text smaller, and centered it on the page. Recently, I figured out how to make page breaks in between each paragraph which makes my journal page look a lot better. For the technical things that I learned this year, I learned about variables, functions, the console, event listeners, the terminal, and github. Variables are a representation of something that you created, and a function helps it carry out its job. Html is what I used to style, create divs, and do all sorts of things that makes my website look the way that it does. In addition, the console can be used to see the code as it's working, but it can also be used to debug the code and look for what can be causing the problem. Event listeners are used to listen for a certain action. For example if I wanted a codesketch where when I would click an image would pop up, I would use an event listener to “listen” for a click. Terminal is what we used to push our websites. By typing certain commands it automatically pushes our changes into github, and from there we can see what changes we made.</p>
