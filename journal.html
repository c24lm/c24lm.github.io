<p>1/30 hi guys. today i worked with jaimie and cameron to develop our websites!</p><br>

<p>3/5 so far in computer science we have learned how to create our own websites, create codeskectches, and learn the basics of using javascript!</p><br>

<p>3/13 So far I have leared a lot of new things about coding. An eventListener takes something and makes it work, a variable represents what you created so you don’t have to type it multiple times, and functions accomplish certain things or get your code to work, or “function.” In addition, I learned about CSS at the very beginning, because it's what we used to style our websites, and Html is similar to that in which it helps organize the website. Lastly, the console is used for giving commands, terminal is what we used to publish our websites, and github is where we created our codepens.</p><br>

<p> 4/8 Today I worked on my animation codesketch. I decided to make one with cats! I was able to incorporate three different ones, the two additional being added using a shortcut. </p><br>



<p> 4/20 Today I finished coding my array on my favorite members from a kpop girl group called Twice! An array is a list of items that are variables that make my whole code sketch work. Using an eventlistener, its "listening" for an "event" to happen which is the mouse click, and when it "hears" the click the images put into the variables in the array will change. The images that appear are random because of the random number generator that I used, therefore you never know what picture of my favorite idols will pop up. Next, I also have functions which essentially tell the variables what to do. I can change what the variable does by changing the function which "tells" it a certain procedure to work, or "function."</p>

<br>

<p> 4/23 Today I made a loop of my favorite member from the kpop group Twice! Her name is Momo Hirai and she is the main dancer of the group. The loop essentially makes the gif that I inserted appear however many times I want and I can change that by changing the number. Since the loop recognizes only the most recent number that the i variable is set to, it automatically counts up from i=1 to i=2, i=3 and so on until it reaches the number I want it to stop at!</p>
