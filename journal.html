<p>1/30 hi guys. today i worked with jaimie and cameron to develop our websites!</p>

<p>3/5 so far in computer science we have learned how to create our own websites, create codeskectches, and learn the basics of using javascript!</p>

<p>3/13 So far I have leared a lot of new things about coding. An eventListener takes something and makes it work, a variable represents what you created so you don’t have to type it multiple times, and functions accomplish certain things or get your code to work, or “function.” In addition, I learned about CSS at the very beginning, because it's what we used to style our websites, and Html is similar to that in which it helps organize the website. Lastly, the console is used for giving commands, terminal is what we used to publish our websites, and github is where we created our codepens.</p>

<p> Today I worked on my animation codesketch. I decided to make one with cats! I was able to incorporate three different ones, the two additional being added using a shortcut.
